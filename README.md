## Introduction

This repository is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The solutions provided are written in Python, but you can easily adapt the concepts to other programming languages.

The problems cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
```
DSA-101/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ arrays/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ problem1.py
â”œâ”€â”€ linked_lists/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ problem2.py
â”œâ”€â”€ trees/
